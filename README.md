- **MovieLens Dataset**: Implements the MovieLens dataset, a widely used resource for movie recommendations.
- **User-Friendly**: Allows users to input their ID to receive personalized movie suggestions.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates the model's accuracy using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for implementation.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Surprise**: A Python library specifically designed for building and analyzing recommender systems.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
